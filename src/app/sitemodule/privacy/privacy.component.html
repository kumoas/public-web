        who register to use the Kumolus Services ("Customers").</p>
    <p>When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Kumolus Services or registering to use the
        Services, Kumolus requires you to provide the Company with personal contact information, such as name, company name,

        such as company annual revenues, number of employees, or industry ("Optional Information"). Required Contact Information,
        Billing Information, and Optional Information are referred to collectively as "Data about Kumolus Customers."</p>
    <p>As you navigate the Company's Web site, Kumolus may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering
        tools, such as cookies and Web beacons ("Web Site Navigational Information"). Web Site Navigational Information includes
        standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol ("IP")
        address, and the actions you take on the Company's Web site (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked).</p>
    <h2>2. Use of Information Collected</h2>
    <p>The Company uses Data about Kumolus Customers to perform the services requested. For example, if you fill out a "Contact
        Information" Web form, the Company will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in the Services.</p>
    <p>The Company may also use Data about Kumolus Customers for marketing purposes. For example, the Company may use information
        you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding
        the Company and its partners, such as information about promotions or events.</p>
    <p>Kumo Holdings uses credit card information solely to check the financial qualifications of prospective Customers and
        to collect payment for the Kumolus Services.</p>
    <p>Kumo Holdings may use Web Site Navigational Information to operate and improve the Company's Web site. The Company may
        also use Web Site Navigational Information alone or in combination with Data about Kumolus Customers to provide personalised
        information about the Company.</p>
    <h2>3. Web Site Navigational Information</h2>
    <p>Kumo Holdings may use commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information
        as you navigate the Company's Web site ("Web Site Navigational Information"). This section describes the types of
        Web Site Navigational Information that may be collected on the Company's Web site and how this information may be
        used.
    </p>
    <h2>3.1 Cookies</h2>
    <p>Kumo Holdings may use cookies to make interactions with the Company's Web site easy and meaningful. When you visit the
        Company's Web site, Kumo Holding's servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally
        identify you. They merely recognise your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to the Kumolus service,
        either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form, you remain anonymous
        to the Company. Kumolus may use cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during
        one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent
        cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.</p>
    <p>If you have chosen to identify yourself to the Kumolus service, the Company may use session cookies containing encrypted
        information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Services, a session cookie
        containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed your browser. These session cookies
        allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions
        and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Services.</p>
    <p>Kumolus may use persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited
        the Company's Web site. When you purchase the Services or provide the Company with personal information, a unique
        identifier may be assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places
        on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information
        stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent
        cookies. If you disable your Web browser's ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company's
        Web site, but you will not be able to successfully use the Services.</p>
    <p>Kumo Holdings may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data about Kumolus Customers
        to provide you with information about the Company and the Services.</p>

    <p>Kumolus may use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors'

        that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web
        site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, Kumolus may place
        Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to
        one of the Company's Web site. Kumolus may use Web beacons to operate and improve the Company's Web site and email
