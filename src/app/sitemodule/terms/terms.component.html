    <h1>Kumolus Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective January 28, 2015</p>
    <h2>1. Your Agreement with Kumo Holdings Pty Ltd.</h2>

    <p>1.1 Your use of the Kumolus service is governed by this agreement (the "Terms"). "Kumolus" is the wholly owned and operated
        cloud management service of Kumo Holdings Pty Ltd. The "Kumolus Services" means the services Kumo Holdings makes
        available through this website, including this website, the Kumolus cloud computing platform, the Kumolus API, the
        Kumolus CLI, the Kumolus Agent, the Kumolus Virtual Appliance, and any other software or services offered by Kumo
        Holdings Pty Ltd via ‘Kumolus’ in connection to any of those.
    </p>

    <p>1.2 In order to use the Kumolus Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You agree to the Terms by actually using
        the Kumolus Services. You understand and agree that Kumo Holdings will treat your use of the Kumolus Services as
        acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.
    </p>

    <p>
        1.3 You agree your purchases of any Kumolus Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features
        or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Kumo Holdings Pty Ltd or any of its affiliates regarding
        future functionality or features. 1.4 IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL
        ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL USERS WHO ACCESS OUR
        SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS "YOU" OR "YOUR" SHALL REFER
        TO SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND USERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT
        AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Your Account and Use of the Kumolus Services.</h2>

    2.1 You must provide accurate and complete registration information. You are responsible for the security of your passwords
    and for any use of your account. 2.2 Your use of Kumolus Services must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and
    ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software. 2.3 You agree not to (a) access (or attempt
    to access) the administrative interface of the Kumolus Services by any means other than through the interface that is
    provided by Kumolus in connection with the Kumolus Services, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a
    separate agreement with Kumo Holdings, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Kumolus Services
    (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service). 2.4 You may not access the Kumolus Services for the
    purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Kumo Holdings or for the purpose of creating
    a product or service competitive with the Kumolus Services. 2.5 You may access Kumolus services via an API (Application
    Program Interface). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses Kumolus,
    is bound by these Terms of Service plus the following specific terms:

    <p>
        You expressly understand and agree that Kumo Holdings shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,
        consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data
        or other intangible losses (even if Kumo Holdings has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting
        from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.
    </p>
    <p>
        Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Kumolus via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your
        account's access to the API. Kumo Holdings, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the
        API. Kumo Holdings will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kumo Holdings reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API
        (or any part thereof) with or without notice.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third Party Cloud Infrastructure Services and Products</h2>

    <p>3.1 In using the Kumolus service it is your responsibility to select the one or more third party Cloud Infrastructure
        products for use with the services.
    </p>

    <p>3.2 The third party Cloud products that operate with the Kumolus Platform are identified on Kumolus’s website and may
        be changed by Kumo Holdings from time to time.</p>

    <p>3.3 Kumolus may arrange with providers of third party Cloud products to provide a single invoice to a client for access
        to the Kumolus Platform and the third party Cloud services. This arrangement will be indicated and agreed to by Kumo
        Holdings and the Client under a separate agreement. In this situation, the Client will pay Fees to Kumo Holdings
        for the third party Cloud services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this separate Agreement and the
        respective Client Order Form. Unless otherwise set forth in a separate agreement and on an individual Order Form,
        Kumo Holdings will not provide a single invoice to Clients and therefore the Client will be solely responsible for
        providing and using their own third party credentials for access to the third party Cloud services. The client is
        therefore responsible for all charges in connection with the operation of such third party accounts.</p>

    <p>
        3.4 In the event that Kumolus makes available links to pricing information in connection with third party Cloud products
        or other Cloud Infrastructure Services, such links and the pricing information are provided without warranty. The
        client is responsible to ensure the accuracy of such information.
    </p>

    <p>
        3.5 The client’s use of a third party Cloud Infrastructure Service is subject to the third party provider’s fees and terms
        and conditions.
    </p>

    <p>3.6 The client’s use of Third Party Products is subject to the additional terms and conditions of the third party providing
        such Third Party Product. The client agrees to comply with all such terms and pay any applicable Fees associated
        with Third Party Products. For the avoidance of doubt, Kumo Holdings is not responsible for any third party fees
        associated with the client’s use of the Kumolus platform.</p>

    <p>
        3.7 THE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE AND THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS ARE NOT KUMOLUS PRODUCTS AND ARE NOT PART OF THE KUMOLUS PLATFORM.
        KUMOLUS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE OR THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS, OR FOR ANY ACTS OR OMISSIONS
        OF THE THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER OF THE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE OR THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS.
    </p>

        any content to you as a client or any third party.
    </p>

    <p>
        4.4 Through the use of the Kumolus product and services you may elect to provide us with access to keys, credentials, or
        passwords (“Keys”) in order that access to your applications and/or third party technology infrastructure is available.
        By providing Kumo Holdings with any such Keys, you as the client authorises Kumolus to use those Keys and to access
        client applications and infrastructure for the purpose of providing Services under this Agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
        4.5 As a Kumo Holdings client you shall not (a) make the Services available to anyone other than authorised users, (b) sell,
        resell, rent or lease the Services, (c) use the Services to store or transmit infringing, libelous, or otherwise
        unlawful or tortious material, or to store or transmit material in violation of third-party privacy rights, (d) interfere

        for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Kumo Holdings reserves the right to discontinue
